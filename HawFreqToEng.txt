Fig., ti leaves, as used in religious ceremonies as a plant respected by spirits. Since some early laws concerned water (wai) rights, some have suggested that the word kānāwai is derived from wai, water; this seems doubtful in view of the many ancient edicts of gods that have no relation to water (also cf. wai 4 and derivatives). Perhaps the most famous kānāwai is the kānāwai kaiʻokia promulgated by the god Kāne after the flood of Kahinaliʻi, promising that ever afterwards the sea would be separated (ʻokia) from the land (i.e., not encroach on the land). Persons swore oaths by this and other kānāwai. The kānāwai of Kū was that no one might lean backwards (kīkiʻi) during ceremonies; that of Ku-kaua-kahi that no one might bend forward (kūpou); that of Kānehekili, that no one might whisper (hāwanawana) during ceremonies; that of Ka-hō-aliʻi, that the white kāʻupu bird (kāʻupu kea) must be used as his symbol during the makahiki.
